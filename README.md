# TicTacToe
*Inspired by the work of Alvin Chris Antony*

+ What is TicTacToe? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe

+ What's the best variant of the game? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe

On a late night Discord chat a few months back, we discovered a way to play Tic Tac Toe with 3 players simultaneously over voice chat. This repo, in the coming months, wil try to replicate and automate that gameplay idea.

Also, see if this is of any relavence to Alvin's rehabilitation project idea (which it may not be)
